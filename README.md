RGB Lights Compaing Three LED Lights Red,Green & Blue. We Adjusting the Brightness Of the LED it Create new Colour. So the LED Adjusting Brightness using Codes(0-255).

Mixing colors
►To produce other colors, you can combine the three colors in different intensities. To generate different colors you can use PWM to adjust the brightness of each LED.
►As the LEDs are very close to each other, we can only see the final colors result rather than the three colors individually.
►To have an idea on how to combine the colors, take a look at the following chart. This is the simplest color mixing chart, there are more complex color charts on the web.

►RGB LEDs have 4 pins which can be distinguished by their length. The longest one is the ground (-) or voltage (+) depending if it is a common cathode or common anode LED, respectively.
